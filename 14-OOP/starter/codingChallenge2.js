// Coding Challenge #2

///////////////codingChallenge1////////////////////
// 1. Use a constructor function to implement a Car. A car has a make and a speed property. The speed property is the current speed of the car in km/h;
// 2. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 10, and log the new speed to the console;
// 3. Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log the new speed to the console;
// 4. Create 2 car objects and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and 'brake' multiple times on each of them.

// DATA CAR 1: 'BMW' going at 120 km/h
// DATA CAR 2: 'Mercedes' going at 95 km/h

/* 
1. Re-create challenge 1, but this time using an ES6 class;
2. Add a getter called 'speedUS' which returns the current speed in mi/h (divide by 1.6);
3. Add a setter called 'speedUS' which sets the current speed in mi/h (but converts it to km/h before storing the value, by multiplying the input by 1.6);
4. Create a new car and experiment with the accelerate and brake methods, and with the getter and setter.

DATA CAR 1: 'Ford' going at 120 km/h

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
